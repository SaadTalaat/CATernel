***EARLIER PROBLEM*****

4th of October 2012
**On User envirnoment initialization:-**
	Mainly we initialize a user envirnoment at this point to test how effective interrupts are when issued from a user space. the way
	we did a user space is to simply put another elf image on the disk shifted by several sectors from kernel and load it into memory
	and jump to it just like we did on boot sector. a far jump with user code segment. But we faced several problems.
	1- We forgot to put a writable permission on the page to be able to load data from disk to memory. But such a behaviour is not 
		 acceptable. since a code segment shouldn't be writable.
	2- We forgot to provide a Ring 3 (SEG|3) Or to a user segment
	3- We did depend on a staticly compiled/linked elf as user env.
	
	Goals are:
		1- to be able to load code into memory without writeable permission, ofc this can be done by disabling writing to page after 
		loading the code, but this should be the role of LDT later.
		2- to be able to switch to user mode. which can be done only by [[http://wiki.osdev.org/Getting_to_Ring_3#Entering_Ring_3|"Fooling the x86 cpu"]]
		3- Provide a data structure with processes operating.
