**Memory Managment.**
	We need an allocation manager for Physical frames, and to divide pages 4Kbs into fragments to lessen the internal and external
	Fragmentation. We need to extend the page.c paging manager. for this point, paging prototype is done.
	Move User stack so user won't be able to edit it.
	We need an allocation manager to divide a page into stubs and do a [best/first/next] fit allocation. our current scheme is allocate
	a page for Anything, childish..
	we need to maintain full power of intel MM by using paging and segmentation togeather as in OS/2


**Interrupts**
	How to transfer from K-Mode to U-Mode and v.versa. 
	Interrupts are for : System calls, Faults, HW interrupt.
	How to interrupt: Change the processor to K-Mode, save old processor, restore processor.

**Scheduling**
	Optimize Scheduling for cpu bound and i/o bound processes, for best performance.
	Set a (when to schedule) bases.
	

**Check**
	- Bouncing Kernel
	- Modular Kernel
