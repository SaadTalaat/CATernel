====== 4.1- Kernel Execution ======
Created Thursday 20 September 2012

Once we jump to our kernel real binary, we first initalize some devices, then we clear up the screen. and re-initalize! and start our prompt!
This actually wont get in more details since you need to know first how did we support these devices!
