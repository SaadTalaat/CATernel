====== 8.3- Soft Task Mangment ======
Created Thursday 04 October 2012

To be able to make a Task manager we need to have some similarity to TSS structure. and keep up with running processes by storing them in a list.
Of course a list is a basic data structure to be modified later. However, a process structure shall have:-
	1- GPR registers.
	2- Segment registers.
	3- Program counter

	4- Process ID.
	5- Process status.

	6- page directory address.
