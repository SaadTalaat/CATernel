====== 8.3- Soft Task Mangment ======
Created Thursday 04 October 2012

To be able to make a Task manager we need to have some similarity to TSS structure. and keep up with running processes by storing them in a list.
Of course a list is a basic data structure to be modified later. However, a process structure shall have:-
	1- GPR registers.
	2- Segment registers.
	3- Program counter

	4- Process ID.
	5- Process status.

	6- page directory address.
	7- times count that process been scheduled and preempted.

**Initialization**
a processes structures table(array) is used to store the processes structures. initially all processes are members of the empty_procs list.
once a process is spwaned a proc structure from the empty procs is filled with proc info and binary is loaded into proc and a virtual memory
allocation function is used to allocate memory.

**Organization**
procs organization is partially like minix. currently ready procs are put into a queue and should be poped by the scheduler. however this is
a premature guess of process organization for scheduling.
