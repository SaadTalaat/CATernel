====== 8.2- Task State segment ======
Created Thursday 04 October 2012

TSS is an intel hardware facility we will use to be able to switch between tasks (Procs/Interrupts/service).
A Task is idetified by It's segment selector of the TSS. The limit, base, flags of the TSS segment selector are 
applied to the task. And since we're using paging we need to keep the base address of the page directory
that task uses always in cr3.

To be able to handle task related activities processor needs
1- TSS
2- Task Gate descriptor
3- TSS descriptor
4- Task register
5- NT Flag in EFLAGS


**Initializing TSS**
although we won't ues TSS in task managment to be able to support ia64 task managment which doesnt support tss, we'll initialize TSS once we've done initializing IDT.


In order to apply a soft task managment unit we are going to immitate and understand some of the TSS features.
