According to Intel Software developer manual Vol 3 [Chp.6 Interrupts and Exception Handling]
an **Interrupt** can be defined as follows:-
	Interrupts occur in random times during execution, and they are invoked by hardware.
	Hardware uses interrupts to handle events that are external to the processor such as 
	request to service a device. software can generate an interrupt also by instruction
	INT <interrupt_number>
	also according to varying soruces interrupt numbers break into the following.
	**IRQ **[Interrupt ReQuest]:
	Interrupt requests are from 0 to 16
	**Interrupts**:
	Interrupts are from 0~31, 8~16, 70h~78h
	**PIC/Keyboard Ports**
	Programmable Interrupt controller and keyboard ports.

an **Exception **can be defined as follows:-
	Exception occurs when a processor detects an error during trying to execute an instruction
	like devision by 0. the intel processor detects many error conditions including protection
	violation as page faults.
