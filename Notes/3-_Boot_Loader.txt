====== 3- Boot Loader ======
Created Thursday 20 September 2012

 the Bootstrapping process is pretty basic one. But more features will be added once the project has a user space. Mainly our bootloader only move to the machine protected mode and activate Gate A20.

When a computer is powered the BIOS comes in control and initializes all data. then it looks for a valid bootloader through in the order of the boot device order. a bootable sector is known by the last 2 bytes in the sector, they must be 0xAA55 (boot signature).That Image has the boot loader of our CATernel.

When the BIOS find a bootable image it loads the first 512 byte into address 0:07C00 then jump to it. then the bootsector comes in control. it starts execution in the real mode. so what we need is to enable the protected mode and to enable the A20 gate for more addressing.Ok!, Let's take a peek at our code. Note, Our code is written in GNU assembly to avoid compiling and linking problems.
