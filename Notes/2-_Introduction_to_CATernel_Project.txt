__Note: Project has a long way to go and we are still working on it .__

There are prerequisites to use this kernel image:-

    First you need to be running on a *nix system
    the bochs IA-32 emulator (bochs)

You build the kernel by navigating to CATerenl/ Directory and running this command in your shell make install, after this you'll find the kernel image in CATernel/kern/kernel/CATernel.img, you will find some object files due to compile process.

To run this image you need first to download and install the bochs emulator. After you've done that you only need to navigate to CATernel/, and run the bochs command. the bochs emulator will show up running the CATernel.img.2
