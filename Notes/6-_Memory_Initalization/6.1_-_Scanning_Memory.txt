====== 6.1 - Scanning Memory ======
Created Friday 21 September 2012

Scanning memory is a trivial step. It's done via the CMOS/RTC data port.

		15    LSB of systemn base memory in Kb
		16    MSB of systemn base memory in Kb
		17    LSB of total extended memory in Kb
		18    MSB of total extended memory in Kb

It's done through reading the LSB of base memory size. and the MSB of base memory size and just adding them togeather.
	cmos_get_reg(15) | (cmos_get_reg(16) << 8);

However, this just returns us the base memory, which is normally 640KB. to calculate the Extended memory which is from. 1MB to 65MB
which leaves us with memory gap 0x60000, it's a memory hole, that might contain ACPI system tables and memory mapped I/O.
however this leaves us with 65MB of total memory, Which is the limitation to the 17/16 EXTMEM ports.
In order to read more memory we can use ports. 30/31 which returns up to 4GB RAM. but we don't need that so far.

Getting the maximum memory size, makes it easy for us to get the maximum physical address that can be used. which is in this case.
64MB/0x4000000.

and as mentioned before we can figure out how many pages we need, which is simply Maximum address/Page Size. in this case it is 4000 Page.
in order to map 4000 page we need one page directory and 4 tables.
