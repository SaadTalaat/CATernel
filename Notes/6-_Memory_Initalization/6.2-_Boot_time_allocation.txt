====== 6.2- Boot time allocation ======
Created Friday 21 September 2012

unlike Minix, Linux. CATernel uses a boot time allocation, this type of allocation operates on physical memory
Level, Which makes it dangrous for usage after Linear/Virtual memory activation. However, This allocation sc-
heme uses a symbol provided by the linker at the end of the kernel [LOAD] program header called "end". after
this symbol memory is allocatable or free, we use this type of allocation to allocate only and only the page di-
rectory. unlike Linux a page table is provided statically at boot time.

----------------
ENTRY(initial_page_table)
        .fill 1024,4,0
.	.	.	
.	.	.
ENTRY(initial_page_table)
        .long   pa(initial_pg_pmd+PGD_IDENT_ATTR),0     /* low identity map */
# if KPMDS == 3
        .long   pa(initial_pg_pmd+PGD_IDENT_ATTR),0
        .long   pa(initial_pg_pmd+PGD_IDENT_ATTR+0x1000),0
        .long   pa(initial_pg_pmd+PGD_IDENT_ATTR+0x2000),0
# elif KPMDS == 2
        .long   0,0
        .long   pa(initial_pg_pmd+PGD_IDENT_ATTR),0
        .long   pa(initial_pg_pmd+PGD_IDENT_ATTR+0x1000),0
# elif KPMDS == 1
        .long   0,0
        .long   0,0
        .long   pa(initial_pg_pmd+PGD_IDENT_ATTR),0
# else
#  error "Kernel PMDs should be 1, 2 or 3"
# endif
-----------------

also unlike linux also, we don't use any identity table, since it won't be very helpful for us at this point.
