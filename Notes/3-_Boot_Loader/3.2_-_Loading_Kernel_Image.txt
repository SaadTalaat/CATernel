====== 3.2 - Loading Kernel Image ======
Created Thursday 20 September 2012

Our kernel image is an elf binary formatted. so what you really need before reading this is a deep knowledge of ELF. I've wrote the elf.h header which you can find in CATernel/include/elf.h to make it easier for us to read our kernel. But I will give you an ELF crash course here.
