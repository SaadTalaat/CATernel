====== 3.1.1 - Enabling A20 Gate ======
Created Thursday 20 September 2012

On enabling the A20 gate. first we check if input buffer is full by checking if bit 1 is set on the 0x64 port. then output 0xD1 which makes the next byte passed through the 0x60 port written to 804x the IBM AT


D1	write output port. next byte written  to 0060
			      will be written to the 804x output port; the
			      original IBM AT and many compatibles use bit 1 of
			      the output port to control the A20 gate.}

So in the next procedure A20.2, you check if the input buffer is full or not again.. then you write 0xDF to the 0x60 port which is written to the IBM AT 804x port which finally enables A20 gate.


_{DF	enable address line A20 (HP Vectra only???)}
