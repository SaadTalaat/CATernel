CATernel
-=-=-=-=-
	CATernel is a 32-bit protected mode functioning Kernel. so far for the x86 archs.

How is it built
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
	CATernel's BootLoader is in arch/x86/boot/ directory. more archs should be supported as soon as the kernel is fully functional. the true kernel code is supposed to be in the kernel directory.
