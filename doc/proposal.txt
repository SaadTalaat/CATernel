it's important to know that the project was given the name CATernel 5 month ago, since you'll find this name
frequently mentioned. I've attached the documentation of the kernel, and to be more frank It's just the documentation of
the boot-up process and the HOW-TO for it.

It is kinda hard to explain the limitations commercial kernels do on a hardware as intel, and long. To make it breif and
direct. The extra implementation the kernel [CATernel] would do starts from supporting intel facilities based on the hard-
ware driven impelementation(1). Starting from the Paging supported facility by intel through multi-processor management
to supporting the MMX technology and SIMD processing [maybe] even MIMD processing. moreover intel compatibility and a full
Virtualization support. supporting flexibility for Optimization is also a big plus, since intel arch is mainly well designed to
make any additions fit in with no expensive changes to a software.

However, relating the core kernel implementation it should follow standards for Scheduling and Race conditions..etc.
and a monolithic kernel is the goal of this project. the Only changes might be about the Device and system calls in-
terface. the kernel is meant to be tightly related and to have ultimate transparency to the hardware level to achieve the
best performance.

This is the long term plan of the project. Many many plan B[s] might take place in the process. 

==========================================
(1) Unlike other commercial kernels that apply software driven paging.
